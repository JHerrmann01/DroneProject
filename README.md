During winter break, a few of my friends and I from Stony Brook University, RPI, University of Buffalo, and Carnegie Mellon University decided to make a drone from scratch. We began by heavily researching the parts we would need, ordering the parts and messing around with them. After drawing the entire circuit the drone would be wired with, I started writing the software that would be controlling the Motors and Electronic Speed Controllers, Joysticks, Accelerometer, Ultrasonic sensor and Radio Frequency to control the drone. During the process of creating the drone, we ran into a few problems including soldering issues and time constraints for 3D printing the body of the drone although we made it all work. In the future, I will be including a picture of the drone and a video of it's flight. If you have any questions regarding the parts we used, the software, or the 3d printed model of the drone, don't hesitate to contact me via email at Jeremy.Herrmann@stonybrook.edu
